Answers
1. gitignore file contains all the file extensions for files we do not
want to put in source control. It should include .project file.

2. Git does a fast forward when you merge a branch that is ahead of your
checkedout-branch.When we try to merge one commit with a commit that can be
reached by following the first commit's history , Git simplifies things by
moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge
together.

3. Branches help you organize the workflow more efficiently. If there are
5 members in a project it would be a good idea to have 5 branches for
each developer where they can make changes on their own and later on merge 
the changes with the master branch.

4. We can have as many remotes as we want but we can have only one remote 
named "origin". So we usually have only one remote.
